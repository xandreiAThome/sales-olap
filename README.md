# 📊 Data Warehouse Query Processing Project  

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Database** course. It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of **building and querying a data warehouse**, integrating concepts of **dimensional modeling, ETL pipelines, OLAP operations, and query optimization**.  

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives  

The project aims to achieve the following learning competencies:  

### 🏗️ Data Warehouse Design  
- Build a data warehouse using either **Star** or **Snowflake schema**.  
- Perform restructuring of source tables and apply **denormalization** when needed.  

### 🔄 ETL Process  
- Develop **ETL scripts** in Python/SQL to load data from a public dataset into the warehouse.  
- Apply data wrangling tasks such as **cleaning, splitting, merging, aggregating, and transforming** data.  

### 📈 OLAP Application  
- Implement analytical queries that demonstrate OLAP operations:  
  - **Roll-up** → aggregation up the hierarchy  
  - **Drill-down** → finer granularity of data  
  - **Slice** → filter by dimension value  
  - **Dice** → filter by multiple dimensions  
- Build a **web-based interface** to display analytical reports in an organized manner.  

### ⚡ Query Optimization & Performance  
- Apply query optimization strategies:  
  - Efficient **query formulation**  
  - Use of **indexes**  
  - **Database restructuring**  
- Measure and evaluate their impact on **query performance** and **reporting speed**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Database:** MySQL 
- **ETL:** Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) / SQL scripts  
- **OLAP & Queries:** SQL (aggregation, rollup, drilldown, window functions)  
- **Frontend:** Web-based interface (React) for report visualization
